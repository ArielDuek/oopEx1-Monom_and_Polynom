In our project there are 4 main departments, all of the departments have the same interface named function. 
Also, more methods are applied to each department. the 4 main departments:

* Monom:
A mathematical class that represents a monom so that each monom is built from a coefficient, 
variable and power which is not negative.

  For example:
  ax^b, Where a is the coefficient b is the power and x is the variable.

* Polynom:
Polynom is constructed of several monoms, In our implement we decided that the polynomial would be a list of monoms.

  For example:
  ax^b-cx^d+ex^f, Where a,c,e is the coefficients b,d,f is the powers and x is the variable.

* Complex Function:
Complex function built from an arithmetic operator and two functions where each function can be a polynom or monom or a Complex function.

  For example:
  plus(mul(x^2,2x+100),100)

* GUI function:

This class represents a collection of functions that it can save in a file or read from a file or draw as in the image.
